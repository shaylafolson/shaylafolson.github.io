Hello! Welcome to my website. My name is Shayla Olson, and I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Political Science at the University of Michigan. My research fits broadly within American political behavior, with a specific interest in the interaction between race and religion. I am working on a number of projects that help inform our understanding of the politics of white Christians. In particular, I study political communication and political learning in predominately white Christian churches, and how churches form and moderate congregants' racial and political attitudes. I use a variety of methodological approaches, including quantitative and qualitative text analysis and experiments, to examine my research questions.
