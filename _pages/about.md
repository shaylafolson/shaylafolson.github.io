Hello! Welcome to my website. My name is Shayla Olson, and I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Political Science at Michigan State University. I study American political behavior, public opinion, and quantitative methods. My research interests lie at the intersection of American religion and race and ethnicity politics, with a broad focus on social identities and rhetoric.
